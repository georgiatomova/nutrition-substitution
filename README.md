#  Theory and performance of substitution models for estimating relative causal effects in nutritional epidemiology

All data used for the analyses were simulated based on mean, standard deviation, and percentage contribution values similar to those in #NDNS_yr_7_to_8_statistics.xlsx.   
For the food substitution analyses only, real data was used to extract specific means required for the simulation. [NDNS Year 7-8](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-diet-and-nutrition-survey) data can be downloaded from the [UK Data Service](https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk). 

All simulations were conducted using R 4.1.1.  
The file `revised_substitution_simulation_gdt.R` contains the data simulation and analyses used in the 'Theory and performance of substitution models for estimating relative causal effects in nutritional epidemiology' manuscript. Results are summarised in `results_revised_manuscript_gdt.csv`.
